# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well



## What I could do better



## My conclusion about my PRAO

Olle has been an excellent PRAO:

- He was 2 minutes late
- He has shown himself to be polite
- He has shown himself to be able to 
- He has shown himself to be able to give criticism in a mild and
  constructive way
- He was too eager to dive in and get to work. He would
  have achieved more by thinking a bit more at the start,
  but few will criticize this level of enthusiasm
