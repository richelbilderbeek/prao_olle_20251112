# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I treated Olle like a real colleague.
The assignment was at the appropriate level.

## What I could do better

I am unhappy with the last part, which was the reflection.
It was a rushed as Olle was close to solving the problem.
There was no proper time to respond to his feedback:
I flicked through it and I agreed with it, but I could have
taken more consideration for it.
When I gave feedback to Olle, something happened inside of him.
As we were both on our ways out, there was no time to properly address this.

## My conclusion about my PRAO

Olle has been an excellent PRAO:

- He was 2 minutes late
- He has shown himself to be polite
- He has shown himself to be able to listen
- He has shown himself to be able to give criticism in a mild and
  constructive way
- He was too eager to dive in and get to work. He would
  have achieved more by thinking a bit more at the start,
  but few will criticize this level of enthusiasm
- Take proper time to discuss feedback

I definitely recommend Olle as a PRAO!
