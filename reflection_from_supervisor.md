# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I treated Olle like a real colleague.
The assignment was at the appropriate level.

## What I could do better

I am unhappy with the last part, which was the reflection.
It was a rushed as Olle was close to solving the problem.
There was no proper time to respond to his feedback:
I flicked through it and I agreed with it, but I could have
taken more consideration for it.

When I gave feedback to Olle, he was keen to rush away.
I am unsure if this was because of something happened inside of him,
or because it was because he wanted to catch a bus.
Based on what I saw and interpreted in his physique,
I feel it is most likely because there was something happened inside of him.
As we were both on our ways out, there was no time to properly address this.

I sent Olle an email that day, Wednesday 12th November 16:23 with the
text below:

Hi Olle,

I was unhappy with the last part of today, as I feel it was too unclear how much you were appreciated. Here I intend to fix this.

You were one of the best PRAO's I've ever had. You've worked focussed all the time and you were closest to reaching the goals I've ever seen a PRAO do. I expect great things from you in the future and I wish you the best.

Thanks again for today and cheers, Richel

I am happy that I show I care about Olle's feelings.
However, until November 24th 11:44 I have not gotten any reply.
I feel that if Olle wanted to catch a bus during the time I gave him
feedback, he would by now have said so.

## My conclusion about my PRAO

Olle has been an excellent PRAO:

- He was 2 minutes late
- He has shown himself to be polite
- He has shown himself to be able to listen
- He has shown himself to be able to give criticism in a mild and
  constructive way
- He was too eager to dive in and get to work. He would
  have achieved more by thinking a bit more at the start,
  but few will criticize this level of enthusiasm
- I am unsure if he can take criticism
- I am unsure how well he communicates,
  as he did not answer an email I sent him. I sent the email
  to make things clear. Because he did not answer the email (note: it did
  not have a question mark in it) I am uncertain about his mental state.

I recommend Olle as a PRAO: his skills are good, however, he seems to shy away
and/or break contact upon feedback. It would be good if he would practice
receiving criticism.
