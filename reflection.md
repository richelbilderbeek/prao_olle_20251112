# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?
I made a simple script that adds warning comments to a markdown file. The script splits up the contents of the supplied file by \n. Then it checks every line to see if it is empty and the previous line does not have an indent. Then it adds the indices of the changeable lines to an array, which is then used to change out the eligible lines to "<!-- DO NOT EDIT-->". Lastly it updates the supplied file with the new contents.

## What did you do well?
Fighting the borrow checker

## What could be improved?
Perhaps discussing more about different methods to approach the task to understand different approaches to solving certain problems

## What did your supervisor do well?
Listened to questions

## How can your supervisor be improved?
Perhaps explaining the task better - for example, giving more extensive requirements in the instructions - such as how often the comments should be in the document.

## What would you do differently next time?
Comment my code better and give better variable names

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
Ask the supervisor for extensive instructions
