# Report

## Project 1

Repositories:

- [`scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto)
- [SCoRe user documentation](https://nbisweden.github.io/SCoRe_user_doc) 

Example files:

- courses.md: concatenates courses_1.md and courses_1.md
- courses_1.md: written by humans
- courses_2.md: writtem by computer 

Project:

- Problem: it is unclear that files are a mix of human and computer-written text.
- Solution: make it clear in any way (e.g. adding `<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE -->`) to the mixed files
